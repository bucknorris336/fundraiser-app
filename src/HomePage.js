      "We adopted the proven three-band isolators for each individual channel as well as the master isolator from our RDM20. To allow more complex DJ setups, both at home or in club booths, we added a whole set of new features to the RDM40: Dedicated rotary knobs for gain and send are extending the mixers channel strip. The input signals are monitored by a dynamic level indication LED that turns red when the signal is too hot. Using only the best electronic components built into a solid metal housing, this device is made to stand the test of time, even in the rough conditions of the dusty and sweaty club environment.",

Two 36mm illuminated analogue VU meters provide accurate signal level monitoring of the mix buss, these automatically switch to monitoring the Cue level when a channel Cue is activated. If the signal level is excessive, the VU meter illumination will change from warm white to bright red",

    description:
      "The original SL-1200 turntable was embraced by DJs in large part due to its innovative direct drive motor, offering unparalleled accuracy and long-term durability. With the SL-1200MK7, Technics introduces their coreless direct drive motor for even greater sound quality and precision. The coreless motor eliminates the potential for cogging â€” minor speed variations caused by the impulses of a traditional direct drive motor design.",
