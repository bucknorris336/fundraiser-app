### Description

My fundraiser is a project created to help me acquire some gear to help me live one of my dreams. I have been collecting vinyl records for over a decade. One of my best friends who recently passed away would always tell me, "Buck, you have an amazing taste in music, I think you need to share it with all the people who would love to hear it." This is my way of honoring my dear friend Phil, as well as becoming a new creative outlet to express myself. The gear (mixer, turntables) is far from cheap. I need all the help I can get. Helping me make this dream come true would mean the world to me as well as guarantee you a future record I plan on releasing in the not too distant future. Yes, I also produce and record my own music. I have just finished setting up my at home music studio to do just that. Please take a look at my fundraiser page. Thanks
